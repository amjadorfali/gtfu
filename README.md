# GTFU 

This tool is meant to help stubborn developers (like me) get up and touch grass every once in a while.
I am focused on making it cross-platform, though windows is the least of my priorities.

## Why?

1. I can!
2. I want a simple, fast, and customizable breaktimer.

## Features(WIP)!

- [X] Automates the timer and break start/end.
- [X] Supports idle reset.
- [ ] Will force you to take breaks by blocking the screen - Winit
- [ ] Will have minimal setup required.
     - [ ] Will support startup process.
     - [ ] Will save user config. (Use confy)
- [ ] Will have an interactive TUI - Ratatui/Crossterm
- [ ] Will supports multiple breaks.
- [ ] GUI experience (MAYBE/TBD)
